# groupie-tracker-search-bar
## Description


Groupie tracker search bar consists of creating a functional program that searches, inside the website, for a specific text input. So the focus of this project is to create a way for the client to search a member or artist or any other attribute in the data system you made.

    The program  handles at least these search cases :
        artist/band name
        members
        locations
        first album date
        creation date
    The program handles search input as case-insensitive.
    The search bar  have typing suggestions as you write.
        The search bar  identify and display in each suggestion the individual type of the search cases. (ex: Freddie Mercury -> member)
        For example if you start writing "phil" it  appears as suggestions Phil Collins - member and Phil Collins - artist/band. This is  an example of a display.
